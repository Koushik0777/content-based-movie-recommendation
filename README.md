# Content-Based Movie Recommendation System

## Problem Statement
Recommendation systems help users discover relevant content based on their preferences.
The objective of this project is to build a content-based movie recommendation system that suggests similar movies based on movie features.

## Dataset
Publicly available movie dataset containing metadata such as movie titles, genres, and descriptions.
The dataset is commonly used for building recommendation systems.

## Approach
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature extraction from movie metadata
- Similarity computation using cosine similarity
- Recommendation generation based on similarity scores

## Evaluation
- Qualitative evaluation of recommended movies
- Similarity score analysis
- Manual validation of recommendation relevance

## Key Insights
- Content-based filtering works well when user history is limited
- Similarity metrics play a crucial role in recommendation quality
- Recommendations are independent of other users’ preferences

## Limitations
- Does not handle changing user preferences over time
- Limited diversity in recommendations
- Cold-start problem for new or sparse content
